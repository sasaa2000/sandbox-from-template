# System Architecture Overview

The system is intentionally divided into clear layers to ensure security and scalability.

## Public Layer
- Landing page
- Documentation
- Roadmap
- UI previews

Hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Private Layer
- Core business logic
- AI decision systems
- Backend services
- Data handling

This layer is isolated and never exposed publicly.

## Separation Principle
Public content serves visibility and validation.
Private systems handle intelligence and value creation.
